# 🔥 Tinder Clone (React Native + Expo)

A simple Tinder clone built using **React Native** and **Expo**, created as a hands-on learning project
to explore the core functionalities of mobile app development, navigation, and gesture handling in React Native.

This is not a full-featured production app — it’s a project focused on **learning**, **experimentation**, and **getting familiar with building real mobile UIs**.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I built this project to:

* Understand how **React Native** handles UI and native components
* Explore **Expo** for fast prototyping and testing
* Get hands-on with **gesture handling, navigation, and component-based architecture**
* Simulate a real-world app UI to boost confidence in mobile development

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

* React Native component structure and layouting
* Using Expo CLI to bootstrap and test mobile apps
* Implementing swiping functionality using gesture handlers
* Building UI with React Native Elements
* Navigation between screens using React Navigation

---

## 🧪 Next Steps / Ideas

* Add Firebase authentication and Firestore to store real profiles
* Implement a chat system using Firebase Realtime DB
* Add animations and transitions
* Use real user data
